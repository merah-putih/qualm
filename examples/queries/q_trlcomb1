% Now, at T=2, we know that there is a man on the right sidetrack, and furthermore it is possible to divert the trolley to the looping right sidetrack to save the five by hitting the man on this sidetrack (there is an expectation to it and no contrary to that expectation), and therefore the previous alternative divert(left) is not chosen.

% ... would the five have been saved? No.
So, hitting the man on the right sidetrack is instrumental to save the five. Thus it is DDE impermissible. That is, had I known what I know today, alternatively diverting the trolley to the right sidetrack is no DDE morally better than diverting the trolley to the left sidetrack.
